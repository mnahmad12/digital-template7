<h2>GAME TITLE</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game revolves around two fairly simple principles, (1) Get the key, and (2) Don't touch the monsters!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The feeling of almost being caught by the monsters. Much like in tag that moment when the person who is it is right on your tail.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Survival Quest
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The main player is Bob the phaser-dude, and he moves around from input from the arrow keys. He moves left with the left arrow, right with the right arrow and so on. The monsters move at varying speeds and rush directly at Bob and he is to avoid them by moving
around them. This can get tricky at times when they come in swarms. New monsters are spawned every 1/2 second at varying places on the map. Furthermore, Bob is to get the key by touching it. The key is also moving
randomly and every second randomly re-spawns somewhere on the map. The keys and bob are confined to the bounds of the game world and simply bounce off
when they touch a boundary wall. The monsters, however, leave the map and do not return.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
1) Movement
2) Collisions
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What makes this game a bit harder than most is the randomly moving key. It really doesn't follow any pattern so if you aren't lucky it can continue to be generated right by the zombies
making it very hard to win. However this also can lead to a very easy win if it re-spawns right next to you.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game follows the main character (Bob) on his quest to find his lost dog. His dog is kidnapped and will only be returned once he finds the 3 keys that will unlock the mystery of his dogs 
disappearance. The keys, however, are in the ancient Monster Lair. A place rumoured to have monsters that eat phaser-dudes! However, Bob is determined to get back his dog
even if it means being eaten by the monsters!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No true story besides the premise, however, it can easily be turned into a story. As Bob finds the key more and more info can be given to the players
about who stole his dog and why. And maybe it leads up to the demise of this dog-napper.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who are bored and want to stay away from monsters.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Currently the game is only one level, so around 30 seconds-1 minute.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There are 2 potential strategies:
1) Rush at the key and get it quick as possible
2) Try to avoid the monsters and work your way to the key
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets were cloned directly from phasers examples:
	https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-examples/tree/master/examples/assets/sprites
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This is a mix of alot of different examples. The collisions come from tanks, the movement comes from phaser example: change texture on click.
